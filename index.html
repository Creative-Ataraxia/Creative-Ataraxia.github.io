          <p></p>
          <li>I have re-learned how to learn quickly; Systematically solving problems and applying BUD is insanely satifying; Although coding for automation was a hobby, I dedicated myself full-time in the last 2 years to thoroughly study all aspects of computer science;</li>
          <p></p>
          <li>I quickly gained proficiency in languages like <b>python</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>, and using them to solve complex algorithm problems on <a href="https://leetcode.cn/u/roy_m/">leetcode</a> each day:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Gaining deep understanding over data structures and Big-O complexity analysis;</li>
            <li>Implementing key concepts such as recursions, dynamic programming using whiteboard/pseudocode over list, tree and graph traversal problems;</li>
            <li>Also received and successfully completed google's foobar <a href="https://foobar.withgoogle.com/">coding challenge;</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <li>I've also carefully studied the &ltdesign patterns&gt book by the 'gang of four':</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Implementing real-world cases using high-level understandings of volatility based decompositional system design;</li>
              <li>Refactoring existing code bases using the principles of object oriented creational, structural and behavioral, design patterns;</li>
            </ul>
          <p></p>
          <li>I have also spent many hours studying and implementing machine learning models and performing data engineering; I have complete several Kaggle ML challenge projects and is actively contributing to a deep learning open sourced projects called <a href="https://github.com/unifyai/ivy">"Let's unify AI"</a>; contributed thousands lines of code for front/backend modules as well as writing test modules using <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/">hypothesis</a>;</li>
