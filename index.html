        <h2>üë®‚Äçüíª About Me üë®‚Äçüíª</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Full stack software development engineer; Made a full transition into tech in 2019; followed John Washam's <a href="https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university">CS curriculum;</a> Previously financed projects for over 10+ years;</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Most important skill I've acquired on this journey is the ability to quickly taxonomize knowledge and immediately start to implement its practical applications; e.g. To rapidly internalize logic flow behind any library's main classes, methods and patterns; I've became addicted to systematically applying BUD and solving problems; Although I've applied coding for automation in the finance sector; I dedicated myself full-time since the beginning of the pandemic to thoroughly study all aspects of computer science with the aim to became a self-driven, self-sufficient full stack developer;</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I've gained proficiency in <strong>Python</strong> for backend system design, OOP design patterns and API authoring; and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> for authoring frontend webapps; Leveraging modern modules and scaffolding; adding to my tech stacks quickly to achieve modern best-practices;</p>
          <p>For general CS knowledge: I've gained deep understanding over <span>data structures</span> and <span>Big-O complexity analysis</span>;</p>
          <p>Implementing key concepts like <span>recursions</span> and <span>dynamic programming</span> to solve <span>list</span>, <span>tree</span> and <span>graph</span> traversal problems; One of my daily task is to consistently solve coding challenges on <a href="https://leetcode.cn/u/roy_m/">leetcode</a></p>
          <p>Also received and successfully completed google's foobar <a href="https://foobar.withgoogle.com/">coding challenge;</a></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I've studied the <span>&ltdesign patterns&gt</span> book by the 'gang of four' to gain a thorough understanding of object oriented creational, structural and behavioral design patterns; and volatility based decompositional system design; Leveraging the insights to designed my own webapps from authoring PRD all the way to deployment;</p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>I have developed deep interests in data sciences and machine learning. I've performed data engineering and implemented deep learning models ; I have completed several Kaggle ML challenge projects and is actively contributing to a deep learning open sourced projects called <a href="https://github.com/unifyai/ivy">"Let's unify AI"</a>; authored thousands of lines of code for frontend/backend modules as well as writing test modules using <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/">hypothesis</a>;</p>
