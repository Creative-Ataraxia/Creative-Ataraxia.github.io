        <h2>üë®‚Äçüíª About Me üë®‚Äçüíª</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>&emsp;A finance professional raised funds over 10+ years; Made a full transition into tech in 2019; followed John Washam's <a href="https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university">CS curriculum</a> to become a full-stack software development engineer;</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>&emsp;I have re-learned how to learn quickly and efficiently; e.g. quickly understanding the flow behind main classes and methods of a new library, and immediately start to use its APIs in my own project patterns; Also, systematically solving problems and applying BUD is insanely satifying; Although coding for automation was a hobby, I dedicated myself full-time in the last 2 years to thoroughly study all aspects of computer science; Taking and organizing copious amount of notes for every detail;</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>&emsp;I quickly gained proficiency in languages like <strong>python</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and using them to solve complex algorithm problems on <a href="https://leetcode.cn/u/roy_m/">leetcode</a> each day:</p>
          <p>&emsp;Gaining deep understanding over data structures and Big-O complexity analysis;</p>
          <p>&emsp;Implementing key concepts such as recursions, dynamic programming using whiteboard/pseudocode over list, tree and graph traversal problems;</p>
          <p>&emsp;Also received and successfully completed google's foobar <a href="https://foobar.withgoogle.com/">coding challenge;</a></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>&emsp;I've also carefully studied the &ltdesign patterns&gt book by the 'gang of four':</p>
          <p>&emsp;Implementing real-world cases using high-level understandings of volatility based decompositional system design;</p>
          <p>&emsp;Refactoring existing code bases using the principles of object oriented creational, structural and behavioral, design patterns;</p>
          <p>&emsp;Designed my own applications from authoring PRD all the way to deploying on hostings;</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>&emsp;I have also spent many hours studying and implementing machine learning models and performing data engineering; I have complete several Kaggle ML challenge projects and is actively contributing to a deep learning open sourced projects called <a href="https://github.com/unifyai/ivy">"Let's unify AI"</a>; contributed thousands lines of code for front/backend modules as well as writing test modules using <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/">hypothesis</a>;</p>
